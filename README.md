# PS1Shooter

In my efforts to learn all the major parts needed to develop games in Unity, I've learnt about 3D modelling ([Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD)) and shaders ([Freya Holm√©r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfM-yu0iQBk)).

In order to practice the skills I've learnt, I want to make a basic shooter in the style of a PS1 game.

The current points to count this as a success are;
* A look that emulates PS1 style-graphics - very few polygons, polygon wobble, etc.
* A basic room, player model, enemy model, and any extra props.
* Good feeling third person shooter mechanics.
